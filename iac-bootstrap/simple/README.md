# InfraDots simple organization bootstrap
This blueprint creates a simple bootstrap:
* One VCS connection used below
* Two workspaces - dev and prod
* Two variables per workspace - env and account_id

*NOTE* The VCS connection must be confirmed in the settings tab from a VCS user in the case of Github.
